# Lane Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

This project implements a basic lane detection pipeline using OpenCV for autonomous driving applications. It processes video input, detects road lane lines, and overlays them on the frames.

## 🚗 Features
- Canny Edge Detection
- Region of Interest (ROI) masking
- Hough Transform to detect lines
- Overlaying detected lane lines on the original video
- Real-time video frame processing
